presence:
  # How often bot presences switch in seconds, set to -1 to update on guild join/leave
  changeInterval: 60
  # Determines how to switch presences, which can be:
  # - CYCLE: go through each presence in order
  # - RANDOM: randomly pick a presence with duplicates
  # - RANDOM_UNIQUE: randomly pick a presence without duplicates
  behavior: RANDOM
  # A list of presences to change between
  # All require a status, which is ONLINE, IDLE, DO_NOT_DISTURB, or INVISIBLE
  # Type is optional, which can be PLAYING, STREAMING, LISTENING, or COMPETING
  # If type is defined, content is the text that displays ("playing <content>")
  # Content will be limited to 128 characters
  presences:
    - status: ONLINE
      type: PLAYING
      content: "@%bot_username% help | %guilds% guilds"
      url: "https://example.com/url-that-only-displays-when-type-is-STREAMING.php"
      weight: 1

announcements:
  # Turns on or off announcements in the embed footer
  enabled: false
  # This decides what the bot will do if there are no announcements for a given language
  # If true, the announcements for the default language will be used instead
  # If false, no announcements will show
  fallbackToDefaultLang: false
  # Use the language code for each language (example: pt_BR)
  # Content will be limited to 2048 characters
  announcements:
