# Hope you enjoy self-hosting.
# To start the bot, all you need to edit is the token,
# but of course you can also configure everything else.
#
# To get user/channel/guild IDs:
# - Go to User Settings in Discord
# - Click "Appearance"
# - Turn on Developer Mode
# - You can now right click to get IDs
#
# For help, check out these resources:
# GitHub: https://github.com/Tisawesomeness/Minecord
# Support Server: https://minecord.github.io/support
# Remember to grab the self-hosting role in #self-roles in the support server!
#
# Pull requests are welcome!
# If you make changes, we would love for you to contribute them
# to the main bot so everyone else can enjoy them too.
#
# Remember that Minecord uses the GNU AGPL-3 license,
# so if you make changes on a public self-hosted bot, you must make it open source.
# You can link to the GitHub page in branding.yml.
